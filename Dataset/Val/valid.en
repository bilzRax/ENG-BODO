Most cases of infective conjunctivitis will heal without treatment within one to two weeks.
If you are still suffering from the symptoms of conjunctivitis after two weeks, you will need to see your GP again, so that they can reassess your diagnosis and treatment.
Your GP will make sure that you are not suffering from a different form of the condition, such as allergic, or irritant conjunctivitis, as this will affect the type of treatment you are prescribed.
Your GP will also check to see that you are not suffering from any other eye condition, such as blepharitis which is a condition that causes your eyelids to become inflamed and swollen.
It is very important for you to seek medical assistance if you experience these symptoms because it may be an indication that there is a more serious condition that is causing them.
This is why it is important for your GP to rule out any other conditions which, if undiagnosed, may possibly cause serious complications.
Acute glaucoma - this is a rare form of glaucoma which causes a build up of pressure in the eye.
Symptoms of pain, and loss of vision, can develop very rapidly.
Left untreated, acute glaucoma can result in a permanent loss of vision.
Keratitis - this is when your cornea (the clear layer at the front of your eye that allows light to travel through your eye) becomes inflamed, and sometimes ulcerated.
In severe cases, this can cause scarring of the cornea, which can lead to a permanent loss of vision.
Iritis - this condition causes your iris (the coloured part of your eye, behind the cornea) to become inflamed.
If you have iritis, and it is not treated, it can cause the iris to stick to the front surface of the lens, which prevents fluid draining from the pupil.
This can cause permanent damage to the eye.
If your GP is unsure about the diagnosis, or needs to determine the cause of your infection, they may have to take a swab from your infected eye.
This will be tested in a laboratory to find out the cause of your condition.
Your GP can then provide you with the most appropriate treatment.
While your GP is awaiting the results of your swabs, you may be prescribed a short course of antibiotics to help keep your symptoms under control.
When your GP finds out the results of the swab, you will then be prescribed the most suitable form of treatment for the cause of your condition.
If your baby is 28 days old, or younger, and displays symptoms of infective conjunctivitis, it is important to contact your GP straight away.
Many babies may have what is known as a 'sticky eye'.
This usually occurs when the tear (lachrymal) duct cannot drain properly.
If it cannot drain, it produces a discharge of pus, which can look similar to infective conjunctivitis.
However, this condition is not serious, and does not require urgent treatment.
If your baby also has redness in their eye, it may be a sign that the eye is infected.
Your GP will examine your baby closely to see if this is the case.
Any newborn babies with infective conjunctivitis must be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) straight away, so that their condition can be managed and treated to prevent any damage occurring to the eye.
Infective conjunctivitis in newborn babies (neonatal conjunctivitis) can, in rare cases, cause serious complications (see 'complications' section).
However, with prompt treatment, most babies will make a full recovery.
The majority of cases of infective conjunctivitis do not require any medical treatment.
As most infections will heal without treatment within one to two weeks, your GP may not initially prescribe any particular medicines or treatment for you.
In most cases, antibiotics will make little difference to your recovery from infective conjunctivitis.
Therefore, you may be advised to delay using the medicine for seven days in order to see if the condition can resolve itself first.
About 10% of people who have their infective conjunctivitis treated with antibiotics experience adverse side effects.
The risk of any complications from untreated infective conjunctivitis is very low, and so treatment with antibiotics is rarely necessary.
If your infective conjunctivitis is particularly severe, and has lasted for more than two weeks, you may require antibiotic treatment.
Some schools, or playgroups, insist that a child is treated with antibiotics before they can return (although this is rarely necessary - see 'prevention' section).
However, if this is the case, your GP may agree to prescribe antibiotics.
If you have been prescribed eye drops, your vision may become blurred shortly after using them.
You should not to drive, or operate machinery straight after using eye drops, and, before doing so, you should always make sure that your vision is clear.
If you still have symptoms after two weeks, it is very important that you go back to your GP, so that your condition can be reassessed, and your treatment reviewed.
The burrows of scabies mites can be highlighted by using an ink test.
The ink is rubbed around an area of itchy skin, and is then wiped off using an alcohol pad.
If scabies burrows are present, some of the ink will remain and will have tracked into the burrows, showing up as a dark line.
To confirm the diagnosis, a sample of skin may be gently scraped from the affected area, for examination under a microscope.
The sample will be used to look for the mites, their eggs, and their faeces.
A diagnosis can often be confidently made if more than one family member has the same symptoms.
Although over-the-counter (OTC) treatments are available for scabies, it is recommended that you visit your GP if this is the first time you have had a scabies infestation.
This is because other, more serious skin conditions can cause similar symptoms to scabies.
It is therefore important for your GP to rule these out as a cause of your symptoms.
However, if another member of your household has already been diagnosed with scabies, you will not need to visit your GP and should proceed with treatment.
The two most widely used treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and malathion cream.
Permethrin is usually recommended first, and malathion cream is used if the permethrin cream proves ineffective.
Both creams contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite.
If you are using permethrin cream, you should apply it to your whole body, from your chin and ears downwards making sure that your include the ears.
If you are using the cream on a child who is under two years of age, you should also apply the cream to their scalp, face, and ears.
When applying the cream, you should pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and the areas of skin under the nails.
You will need to leave the cream on for between 8-12 hours.
If you wash your hands, or any other part of your body, during this time, you will need to reapply the cream.
Treatment must be repeated after seven days.
The instructions for applying malathion cream are exactly the same as for permethrin cream, except that you need to leave the cream on for 24 hours, rather than between 8-12 hours.
Again, you will need to repeat the treatment after seven days.
On the same day that you first apply the cream, you should also wash all clothes, bed linen, and towels, at a temperature of above 50C (122F).
If you are unable to wash certain items, place them in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours, by which time the mites will have died.
It is not necessary to fumigate furniture, pets, or carpets.
If you have been diagnosed with scabies, you should avoid any close and prolonged physical contact with other people until you have applied the cream for the first time.
You should also avoid close contact with other household members until their treatment has been completed.
Children and adults can return to school, or work, after the first application of cream has been completed.
Your GP should also be able to prescribe creams, such as a mild steroid creams, that can help relieve the symptoms of itchiness.
The over-the-counter (OTC) remedy, camomile lotion, may also help to relieve itchy skin.
Oral antihistamines can help to control symptoms of itching and help with sleeping.
These can be bought over- the counter (OTC) at your local pharmacy.
However, they might cause drowsiness, so avoid driving, or operating heavy machinery, if you are affected in this way.
If you unsure, check with your GP, or pharmacist.
The symptoms of itchiness can persist for several weeks after treatment because your immune system is still reacting to the presence of dead mites and their waste products.
See your GP if the symptoms of itchiness persist for more than six weeks.
A doctor usually makes a firm diagnosis based on the characteristic signs and symptoms.
A sample of saliva from the back of the throat (a throat swab) is taken, to be tested in the laboratory.
This helps to confirm the bacteria causing the infection.
In certain cases, a blood test may be required.
This means that your doctor must report any cases to the local health authorities so they can monitor the spread of the disease.
Most mild cases of scarlet fever will go away in about a week or so even without treatment.
However, it is advised that you seek treatment to speed recovery and to avoid any complications.
With treatment, most people recover after 4 to 5 days.
The common treatment for scarlet fever is a 10 day course of antibiotics.
This will usually be penicillin taken by mouth.
If your child is allergic to penicillin, then the antibiotic erythromycin can be used instead.
Symptoms usually go in a few days if the antibiotics are taken properly.
The whole course of treatment must be finished, to make sure the infection is fully cleared.
The fever will normally disappear within 12 to 24 hours of starting the antibiotic course.
It is a good idea for the person with scarlet fever to drink plenty of cool fluids, especially if they have little appetite.
It is also best to keep the room at a cool temperature.
Paracetamol can also be taken to relieve aches and pains and bring down a high temperature.
If left untreated, the skin may continue shedding for several weeks after and there is a higher risk of complications.
This is made on the basis of the symptoms and clinical signs, the culture of the germs from the blood, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid through lumbar puncture.
See the 'related articles' section for more information about lumbar punctures.
If meningitis is suspected, antibiotics must be given immediately without waiting for confirmation from germ culture.
The glass (tumbler) test can be used to determine if a rash might be septicaemia by pressing the side of a clear drinking glass onto the rash or bruises and checking that they fade.
If they do not fade, the rash is more likely to be due to septicaemia.
In a small number of cases the rash may fade at first but may later change into one that does not fade.
Urgent treatment with antibiotics and appropriate hospital management is essential for someone with bacterial meningitis.
The sooner they are diagnosed and treated, the greater chance there is they will make a full recovery.
Anyone who has been in direct, close, prolonged contact with the infected person (normally family members and those deemed to be at an increased risk) should be given appropriate protective antibiotics if necessary.
Viral meningitis cannot be helped by antibiotics and treatment is based on good nursing care.
Recovery is normally complete, but headaches, tiredness and depression may persist for weeks or even months.
Malaria is a tropical disease passed on to humans by mosquitoes, and is present in over 100 countries.
Occasional isolated outbreaks have been reported in England, particularly by airport workers, and those who have contact with items imported from other countries.
Altogether, around 2,000 cases of malaria are brought into the UK each year.
Malaria predominantly affects countries in Africa, south and central America, Asia, and the middle east.
The disease is particularly widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, where over 90% of malaria-related deaths occur.
Almost two thirds of all cases of malaria-related deaths occur among the poorest 20% of the world's population.
Benign malaria is milder and relatively easy to treat.
Malignant malaria can be very severe, and is sometimes fatal.
If malignant malaria is suspected, immediate medical attention is required.
Chickenpox is a highly infectious disease caused by one of a group of viruses called the Herpes viruses.
There are many different types of Herpes virus, but one feature which they all have is that they lie dormant in the body after the initial infection, and can reactivate much later.
The disease caused by the reactivation of the chickenpox virus is known as shingles and it may occur when the immune system is run down.
Flu (also known as influenza) is a disease of the lungs and upper airways caused by infection with a flu virus.
The virus spreads in the lungs and airways.
There are three flu viruses, known as A, B and C. The main symptoms are a high temperature that comes on quickly and general aches and pains.
You may also experience a loss of appetite, nausea and a harsh dry cough.
Your symptoms will usually peak after 2-3 days and you should begin to feel much better within 5-8 days, although a cough and general tiredness may last for 2-3 weeks.
The flu virus is usually spread in the small droplets of saliva coughed or sneezed into the atmosphere by an infected person.
Direct contact with hands contaminated with the virus can also spread infection.
It takes between 1-4 days (average 2 days) to go from being infected to having the full symptoms.
People with flu are usually infectious a day before symptoms start and remain infectious for approximately 5 days after the start of the flu symptoms.
Children and people with lowered immune systems may remain infectious for longer.
You should, therefore, try to avoid all unnecessary contact with others during the infectious period.
Flu usually occurs during the winter months, from October to April in the UK.
Complications such as a chest infection can affect people who are elderly, or those with certain medical conditions.
This can result in serious illness and can be life threatening.
The number of people who consult their GP with flu-like illness during the winter varies considerably from year to year (usually between 50 and 200 for every 100,000 population).
However, healthy people with flu do not need to consult their GP.
An epidemic can be declared if more than 400 people per 100,000 of the population consult their GP with flu or a flu-like illness every week.
Flu-like illness describes a variety of other illnesses, which result in similar symptoms.
Around half of all acute cases of hepatitis are due to a viral infection.
Several kinds of hepatitis virus can infect the liver, but the most common are the hepatitis A and B viruses.
Hepatitis A is caught through the contamination of food and water with faeces (stools) through poor personal hygiene or sanitation.
Hepatitis B is spread through the exchange of blood and body fluids.
It can be caught through unprotected sex, unsterilised needles, needlestick injury (accidental puncture of skin by a used needle), or contaminated blood products.
Hepatitis C is also spread through the exchange of blood or blood products.
It is spread through sharing needles and needlestick accidents.
It was also spread by blood transfusions before September 1992, when screening for hepatitis C was brought in.
There are four other recognised hepatitis viruses, named from C to G. Hepatitis A and E cause only acute infection, while hepatitis B and C cause chronic (ongoing) illness.
Hepatitis D is only present in people infected with hepatitis B. The glandular fever virus can also be a cause of hepatitis.
Vaccinations are available for hepatitis A and hepatitis B (singly or combined), and also as a combination of hepatitis A and typhoid.
Autoimmune hepatitis is a very rare cause of chronic hepatitis (long-term inflammation).
The reasons are still unknown as to why the immune system that usually attacks any viruses, germs or bacteria, begins to attack the body, mistaking organs as one of these foreign bodies.
In autoimmune hepatitis your white blood cells (called lymphocytes) attack your liver causing chronic inflammation and damage.
This can then lead to more serious problems such as liver failure.
Autoimmune hepatitis is very uncommon in the UK, with only 1 in 100,000 cases being diagnosed every year.
About 7 in 10 cases are in women usually between the ages of 15-40.
However, men tend to be more affected than women in older age groups.
See your GP immediately if you begin to show any of these symptoms so that tests can be carried out for an early diagnosis.
Treatments for autoimmune hepatitis involve medicines that help suppress the immune system to reduce inflammation.
Steroid medication (prednisolone) can gradually reduce your swelling over several weeks, and then be used to control your symptoms.
Hepatitis A is an infection caused by the hepatitis A virus, which leads to inflammation of the liver.
It is the most common type of viral hepatitis.
Hepatitis A does occur in the UK, but it is more common in some other countries where sanitation and sewage disposal can be poor, particularly Africa, northern and southern Asia, Central America and southern and eastern Europe.
It mostly affects children and young adults.
The virus is usually caught by putting something in your mouth that has been contaminated with the stools (faeces) of someone with hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is usually an acute (short term) infection and though the symptoms can be unpleasant, it is very rarely serious.
Hepatitis A can occur at any age.
The incubation period (the time from coming into contact with the virus to developing the infection) is approximately between 2-6 weeks.
Hepatitis is a general term that means inflammation of the liver.
Inflammation of the liver can result from infection, from exposure to alcohol, certain medications, chemicals, or poisons, or from a disorder of the immune system.
Hepatitis A refers to liver inflammation caused by infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV).
HAV is one of several viruses that can cause hepatitis and is one of the 3 most common hepatitis viruses in the United States.
The other 2 are hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Unlike hepatitis B and hepatitis C, hepatitis A does not cause chronic (ongoing, long-term) disease.
Although the liver does become inflamed and swollen, it heals completely in most people without any long-term damage.
Once you have had hepatitis A, you develop lifelong immunity and cannot get the disease again.
Because of the way it is spread, the hepatitis A virus tends to occur in epidemics and outbreaks.
As many as 1 in 3 people in the United States have antibody to HAV, meaning they have been exposed to the virus, but most do not become ill. The number of cases of hepatitis A in the United States varies among different communities and has not been affected significantly by the introduction of the hepatitis A vaccine since the early 1990s.
Hepatitis B is a virus which spreads through the blood and bodily fluids of an infected person.
Hepatitis B is 100 times more infectious than HIV, with many people not even realising they have been infected with the virus.
This is because symptoms may not develop immediately, or at all.
The incubation period (time from coming into contact with the virus to developing the infection) is between one and six months.
A blood test is carried out to detect the virus.
The virus is present in body fluids such as blood, saliva, semen and vaginal fluid.
It can be passed from person to person, such as through unprotected sex (without using a condom) or by sharing needles to inject drugs.
Infected mothers can also transmit the virus to their baby during childbirth (often without the woman being aware that she is infected).
The hepatitis B virus can go on to cause a chronic (long-term) illness, which follows an acute infection.
This is very common in babies and young children, but it can also occur in adults.
If you develop chronic hepatitis B, you may remain well, but you may pass on the virus because you are a carrier.
Symptoms may come and go, or you may develop serious liver damage.
The occurrence of hepatitis B is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, south east Asia, and the Pacific Islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands, the Solomon Islands, and Fiji.
The lowest incidence of hepatitis B is found in Australia, New Zealand, northern and western Europe, and North America.
There are approximately 350 million carriers of the virus worldwide.
There is a vaccine available to protect against hepatitis B. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness.
The illness causes a range of symptoms including fever, coughing, and distinctive red-brown spots.
The infection is spread through the air through droplets of saliva.
You can catch measles through direct contact with an infected person, or through the air when they cough or sneeze.
The droplets can also survive, and remain contagious, on surfaces for a few hours.
Measles is most common among children aged between 1-4 years of age, but anyone who has not be immunised against the condition, can catch it.
Symptoms of the measles appear 9 to 11 days after the infection begins, and last up to 14 days.
The condition is most infectious after the first symptoms have appeared, and before the rash has developed.
Treatment for the measles is normally not necessary because the body's immune system (defence against viruses) can usually fight off infection in a couple of weeks.
Typically, once somebody has fought of the measles infection, they develop immunity to it.
Complications of measles include pneumonia, ear and eye infections, and croup (an infection of the lungs and throat).
More serious complications, such as inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), are rarer but can be fatal.
There are one million deaths world-wide from the measles every year.
The most effective way of preventing measles is the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which also provides protection against two other potentially fatal childhood conditions - mumps and rubella.
The success of the MMR vaccine means that, in the UK, cases of measles are rare.
However, in recent years, the number of cases of measles has been increasing.
For example, there were 739 cases in 2006, compared with 70 cases during 2001.
It is thought that the rise in the number of cases of measles is the result of parents not getting their child vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.
This is probably due to speculation linking MMR to autism (a condition that effects the development of the brain, and can lead to problems in communication and social interaction).
Publicity in 1998 highlighted a report claiming a link between the MMR jab and autism.
However, numerous studies undertaken to investigate this claim found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.
Measles, a disease recognised for over two thousand years, is a highly contagious, acute infection caused by the rubella virus.
It is seen in every country of the world.
Before the use of vaccines, epidemics of measles occurred every two to five years.
Cough, cold, fever and a skin rash that begins several days before the initial symptoms characterise the illness.
Recovery from measles is usual, but serious complications of the respiratory and central nervous system may occur.
Chicken Pox is an ubiquitous and extremely contagious viral illness.
The primary illness, characterised by a generalised skin rash, is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus.
Recurrence of the infection results in a localised skin rash, otherwise known as shingles or Herpes Zoster.
Chicken Pox, often confused with Small Pox in earlier times, occurs seasonally and in epidemics the world over.
The virus is spread by the respiratory route and is a common infection in children.
Malaria is one of the major scourges of mankind in the developing world.
It is estimated to affect more than 500 million people causing between one and three million deaths every year.
Though, to a large extent, it has been eradicated from large parts of North America and Europe, it is rampant in most areas of the tropics.
Travellers to the tropics have to specially safeguard themselves against the risk of malaria.
Typhoid fever is an acute, systemic infection presenting as fever with abdominal symptoms, caused by Salmonella typhi and paratyphi.
Before the 19th century, typhus and typhoid fever were considered to be the same.
Enteric fever is an alternative name for typhoid.
Salmonella typhi and paratyphi colonise only humans.
The organisms are acquired via ingestion of food or water contaminated with human excreta from infected persons.
It is seen in children older than the age of one.
Outbreaks of typhoid in developing countries result in high mortality.
Recently, the development of antibiotic resistant organisms is causing much concern.
Polio, also known as poliomyelitis, is a condition caused by a highly infectious virus.
For most people, polio is a mild illness and only causes flu-like symptoms.
However, for others, polio is a potentially fatal condition, which can cause severe muscle paralysis (paralytic polio).
This is because a severe case of polio attacks the nerve cells that help the muscles to function.
In the past, polio was a very common condition.
However, today, as a result of widespread vaccination, the number of polio cases has been dramatically reduced.
Since 1993, there have not been any cases of polio in the UK, and there are now only four countries where the condition remains a serious problem - Nigeria, India, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.
This is why the best way to deal with the condition is to prevent it.
It is, therefore, very important that you make sure that your child receives all of their necessary immunisations as they are growing up.
Post-polio syndrome is a condition which affects approximately 20-66% of people who have had polio.
You may develop post-polio syndrome between 10-40 years after your initial illness.
The syndrome can cause new muscle pain and weakness, and can also leave you feeling fatigued and lethargic.
This may make it difficult for you to get around, or carry out everyday tasks and activities.
It is not known what causes post-polio syndrome.
Some theories suggest that the polio virus can sometimes lay dormant in your system after your original infection because your immune system has not completely destroyed it.
This dormant virus can then become 're-activated', although it is not known what triggers this re-activation.
Other theories suggest that the syndrome is the result of damaged nerve cells which gradually deteriorate over time.
In recent years, post-polio syndrome has become a more common condition in the UK, largely due to the high number of polio cases during the 1940s and 1950s.
However, now that polio is no longer naturally active in the UK, post-polio syndrome should become much rarer in the future.
Tetanus is caused by bacteria (germs) that get into your body through a wound, such as a cut while gardening, or an animal bite.
You are more at risk of developing tetanus if the wound is deep or if it gets dirty with soil or manure, but even small wounds such as a prick from a thorn can allow enough bacteria to get into your body to cause tetanus.
Once inside your body, the bacteria release a toxin (poison) which then causes tetanus, although the illness can take up to 21 days to develop.
Tetanus affects your nerves, and can be fatal.
Tetanus is quite rare in the UK because many people are vaccinated against it.
A full course of tetanus immunization consists of five doses of vaccine.
This vaccine enables your body to create antibodies against the tetanus toxin, which then protect you from the illness if you were to become infected with the bacteria.
A cold is an infection that affects the upper respiratory tract - the nose, throat, sinuses (small spaces in the skull behind the eyes and nose), trachea (the main airway that runs to the lungs), larynx (voice box) and bronchial tubes (the airways in the lungs).
Colds are caused by viruses and can be spread in several ways.
If you have a cold and you sneeze, cough or speak, tiny droplets of fluid containing the cold virus are launched into the air.
If these are breathed in by someone else then they may become infected.
Colds can also spread through direct and indirect contact.
If you have a cold and you touch your nose or eyes and then touch someone else, you may pass the virus on to them.
Alternatively, if you touch an object such as a door handle or telephone, the virus may be transferred to the object.
If someone touches the object a short time later and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes, they may become infected.
The symptoms of a cold usually begin 2-3 days after you become infected, and last for 2-14 days.
Most people recover from a cold within a week.
You are most contagious when you have the sneezing, runny nose and cough that are the first signs of a cold developing.
They occur mainly during the winter months, although cold weather itself is not a cause of colds.
Children tend to have more colds than adults.
This is because adults have built up immunity against some of the viruses that cause colds.
On average, adults have between two and four colds a year, while children may have as many as eight or ten.
A common cold is an infection of your upper respiratory tract - your nose and throat.
It's usually harmless, although it may not feel that way.
If it's not a runny nose, sore throat and cough, it's watery eyes, sneezing and congestion - or maybe all of the above.
In fact, because any one of more than 200 viruses can cause a common cold, symptoms tend to vary greatly.
Unfortunately, if you're like most adults, you're likely to have a common cold two to four times a year.
Children, especially preschoolers, may have a common cold as many as six to 10 times annually.
The good news is that you or your child should be feeling better in about a week or two.
If symptoms of a common cold aren't improving in that time, see your doctor to make sure you don't have a complication of a bacterial infection in your lungs, sinuses or ears.
The common cold, also known as a viral upper respiratory tract infection, is a contagious illness that can be caused by a number of different types of viruses.
Because of the great number of viruses that can cause a cold and because new cold viruses develop, the body never builds up resistance against all of them.
For this reason, colds are a frequent and recurring problem.
In fact, on average, preschool children have nine colds a year, those in kindergarten, 12 colds a year; and adolescents and adults, seven colds per year.
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection caused by a germ called the tubercle bacillus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Until effective anti-tuberculosis drugs were introduced about 50 years ago, TB was one of the main causes of death.
TB is still a major problem in many countries.
It has been on the increase in the developed world in recent years, probably because of increased air travel and movement of people from areas where it is common.
It can affect the lungs (pulmonary TB) or other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes (tuberculous adenitis or scrofula), the skin and the bones.
Tubercle bacilli can remain dormant for years before producing active disease.
In most cases lung infection is well controlled by the immune system, and shows no symptoms.
Active lung disease occurs if the immune system becomes less effective.
A person may have had an infection with tuberculosis without being aware.
This can be discovered by a tuberculin skin test, the Heaf (or Mantoux) test.
When positive, it indicates that the person has a degree of natural immunity.
People who test negative do not have this immunity and are more susceptible to infection by TB.
Tuberculin-negative people may benefit from BCG inoculation.
This uses a vaccine made from a modified version of the TB germ.
It reduces the risk of developing TB in about 70% of those vaccinated for approximately 15 years.
From September 2005, a new targeted programme of BCG vaccination was introduced.
Only those people at high risk of contracting TB will be vaccinated, as opposed to all school children in the UK.
Chickenpox is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus (varicella is the medical name for chickenpox).
Chickenpox is a mild, but highly infectious disease that most children catch at some point.
It is most common to catch the disease between March and May. It takes 10-21 days for the symptoms to show after you have come into contact with the virus.
Chickenpox is most common in children who are between 2-8 years of age, although you can develop chickenpox at any age.
You are infectious from about two days before the rash appears until roughly five days after.
Therefore, you, or your child, should stay at home until all of the blisters have fully crusted over, and this usually happens 5-7 days after the first blister appears.
After the last blister has burst and crusted over, you are no longer infectious.
Chickenpox spreads in tiny droplets of saliva and nasal mucus, by sneezes and coughs from an infected person.
The virus is already in these droplets, which is why it spreads so fast.
Once you have had chickenpox, you will very rarely catch chickenpox for a second time.
This is because your body develops immunity to the chickenpox virus, which stops you from becoming re-infected.
After a chickenpox infection, the virus stays in the body's nerve tissues (remains dormant).
It does not do any harm because it is kept under control by the immune system; the part of the body that fights infection.
At any time later in life, but usually when you are an adult, the virus can be reactivated (come back), causing a different form of the virus, known as shingles.
The first sign of shingles is usually a pain in the area of the affected nerve.
Seven days later a rash will usually appear, followed by blisters, that tend to only affect one side of your body.
If you have shingles you are contagious to anyone who has not had chickenpox.
However, it is not possible to catch shingles from someone who has chickenpox.
More than 90% of pregnant women are immune to the chickenpox virus (as a result of having it earlier on in life), so most women need not worry about developing the disease.
Even if you develop shingles during pregnancy, it should not affect your baby in any way.
Chickenpox occurs in approximately three in every 1,000 pregnancies, and can cause serious complications for both you and your child.
Typhoid fever, also known as enteric fever, is a serious infection that is caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi.
The disease is transmitted from human to human and is spread by eating food or drinking water that is contaminated with typhoid bacteria.
Each year, around 150 to 200 cases of typhoid are reported in England and Wales.
However, worldwide, there are 13 to 17 million cases with an estimated 600,000 deaths.
Typhoid fever is a common problem in developing countries, such as India, Africa and South America, where food hygiene and sanitation standards may not be as high as in developed countries.
In these countries, typhoid sometimes causes epidemics.
Therefore, if you are visiting a developing country, it is advisable to have a typhoid vaccination.
Salmonella typhi belongs to the salmonella group which, as well as causing typhoid fever, also causes mild diseases such as food poisoning.
Paratyphoid fever, caused by Salmonella enteritidis paratyphi A, B or C, is a similar infection to typhoid fever but is less severe.
Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Bacillus anthracis.
Anthrax most commonly occurs in livestock, but can also infect humans.
Anthrax is most common in agricultural regions where it occurs in animals.
Although anthrax can be found globally, it is more often a risk in countries with less standardized and effective public health and animal health programs.
Areas currently listed as high risk are South and Central America, Southern and Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East.
When anthrax affects humans, it is usually due to an occupational exposure to infected animals or their products.
Workers who are exposed to dead animals and animal products (industrial anthrax) from other countries where anthrax is more common may become infected with B. anthracis.
Anthrax in animals rarely occurs in the United States and consequently human anthrax is rare here.
Dengue fever is a disease caused by a virus spread by the bite of an infected mosquito, uncommon in Wisconsin.
The disease is common in most tropical and subtropical areas including some islands in the Caribbean, Mexico, most countries of South and Central America, the Pacific, Asia and parts of tropical Africa.
Cases originating in the United States are rare occurring occasionally in southern Texas.
Occasionally, residents from or visitors to countries where dengue fever occurs may arrive in this country and develop dengue fever.
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a sexually transmitted virus (STI) that attacks the body's immune system, which provides a natural defence system against disease and infection.
HIV infects special cells, called CD4 cells, which are found in your blood, and are responsible for fighting infection.
After becoming infected, the CD4 cells are destroyed by HIV.
Although the body will attempt to produce more CD4 cells, their numbers will eventually decline and the immune system will stop working.
This leaves a person who is infected with HIV with a high risk of developing a serious infection, or disease, such as cancer.
HIV is a special type of virus known as a retrovirus.
Retroviruses spread by breaking down the DNA in our cells and then reassembling it to make copies of itself.
Retroviruses are challenging to treat as they can rapidly alter (mutate) into new strains of virus.
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a term that is used to describe the latter stages of HIV, when the immune system has stopped working and the person develops a life-threatening condition, such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs).
The term 'AIDS' was first used by doctors when the exact nature of the HIV virus was not fully understood.
However, the term is no longer widely used because it is too general to describe the many different conditions that can affect somebody with HIV.
Specialists now prefer use the terms 'advanced', or 'late stage' HIV infection.
HIV is a global pandemic, which means that it is a condition that has been spread across the world.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 33 million people around the world are currently infected with HIV.
It is also estimated that 25 million people have died of HIV since the pandemic began in 1981.
The virus is particularly widespread in sub-Saharan Africa - the African countries that lay south of the Sahara Desert, such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.
In the UK, there are 73,000 people living with HIV, and experts believe that 30% of people with HIV do not know that they have the condition.
The number of people who are diagnosed with HIV has been rising since the beginning of the 21st century.
It is thought that this is due to people wrongly thinking that HIV is no longer a threat to the public health.
The HIV virus can be spread through the exchange of bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, and vaginal fluids.
The most common way that HIV is spread is through sexual intercourse, including oral and anal sex.
The virus can also be spread through sharing needles, and from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby.
However, due to advances in treatment, it is now possible to prevent the virus from being passed on by the mother to her child.
However, this does not mean that the condition is only a concern for the gay community.
In the UK, it is estimated that one in ten cases of HIV are acquired during heterosexual sex.
Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the skin.
Non-bullous impetigo is the most common, accounting for over 70% of cases.
The condition is most common in children, normally occurring between the ages of two and four.
However, the condition can affect adults, especially if they are living in a confined environment such as an army barracks.
Impetigo will normally resolve without the need for treatment within two to three weeks.
Antibiotic creams are normally used to treat the infection, to minimise the risk of the condition spreading.
Impetigo is normally not serious, though it is important to take precautions to avoid spreading it to other people, especially newborn babies.
These include carefully washing hands after touching the affected areas of skin and not sharing towels or bed linen.
Most people will no longer be contagious after 48 hours of antibiotic treatment or once their sores have dried up and healed.
They include the infection spreading to the lymph nodes (lymphadenitis) or to a deeper layer of skin (cellulites).
Very rarely the infection can also spread to the kidneys, though this occurs in less than 1% of cases.
Rabies is an infection of the central nervous system that can affect all warm-blooded creatures, including humans.
Rabies is also known as hydrophobia (fear of water).
The rabies virus causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain and is transmitted through saliva from the bite of an infected animal, usually a dog, into the bloodstream.
Once the disease is fully established in a person and they begin to show symptoms, it almost always leads to death.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that between 40,000 and 70,000 people die from rabies every year, as a result of being bitten by a rabid animal.
Urban rabies affects dogs and cats; Sylvain (wild) rabies affects bats and foxes and other wild animals.
Rabies is found in over 150 countries but at least 30 countries, including the UK are now officially classified as rabies free, mainly through strict animal transport controls.
Chicken Pox, also known as Varicella, is an acute and highly contagious disease.
The viral infection is transferred from one person to another through direct contact with the broken chickenpox blisters and through airborne droplets.
People who have never had chickenpox can get infected just by being in a room with someone who has the disease.
There is universal susceptibility to the virus in those not previously infected.
This viral disease is characterized by dry itching (pruritus) and a skin rash with fluid-filled blisters that burst and form crusts.
The onset of the chickenpox rash may be preceded by a day of mild fever and weakness.
The infectious period lasts from about three days before the rash appears until all the blisters have formed scabs.
The incubation period between being infected with chickenpox until the disease breaks out and symptoms appear is 10 to 21 days.
Most children have been infected with the virus by the age of 10.
After infection, lifelong immunity against recurrent infection is usually present. However, a person with a history of chickenpox may develop shingles (herpeszoster) later in life.
In India, it usually occurs in the first six months of the year.
Polio (also called poliomyelitis) is a contagious, historically devastating disease that was virtually eliminated from the Western hemisphere in the second half of the 20th century.
Although polio has plagued humans since ancient times, its most extensive outbreak occurred in the first half of the 1900s before the vaccination, created by Jonas Salk, became widely available in 1955.
At the height of the polio epidemic in 1952, nearly 60,000 cases with more than 3,000 deaths were reported in the United States alone.
However, with widespread vaccination, wild-type polio, or polio occurring through natural infection, was eliminated from the United States by 1979 and the Western hemisphere by 1991.
Diphtheria is a serious and highly contagious disease caused by bacteria called Corynebacterium diptheriae.
This disease affects the upper respiratory tract (nose, throat, voice box and upper windpipe) and occasionally, the skin.
It can affect anyone, at any age and can be fatal.
Diphtheria is now extremely rare in the UK because of routine childhood immunisations since the 1940s but the diphtheria bacteria still exists in the world and nearly all new cases in the UK, are picked up while travelling abroad.
The disease is still active in certain countries of the world, especially in those living in poverty and countries with not enough healthcare.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported that there have recently been large epidemics of diphtheria in several countries of Eastern Europe.
An epidemic is a sudden widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a particular place or area.
South America, South East Asia, parts of India and Russia have also had epidemics in the past few years.
In the UK, babies are routinely immunised (vaccinated) against diphtheria as part of the triple vaccination course at two, three and four months old.
Booster doses are given before starting school and then again between the age of 16 and 18 years.
Because of the success of the immunisation programme in the Western world, generations of parents have grown up knowing nothing about this disease.
The Schick test, in which a tiny quantity of diphtheria toxin protein is injected into the skin of the forearm, can show whether you are still immune to diphtheria.
Get the answers to these questions: When is lunchtime?
What and how much does your child eat at lunch?
Does your child get a snack at his or her after-school program?
This will help you figure out how hungry will your child be when he or she gets home.
You'll also want to think about what time you normally serve dinner.
A child who gets home famished at 3 and eats a large snack probably won't be hungry if dinner is at 5:30.
Likewise, it may not reasonable to expect a child whose parents work late to go until 7:30 with nothing to eat since lunch.
Think about your child's schedule and plan accordingly.
Next, talk about which snacks your child would like to have at snack time.
Come up with a list of healthy options together and be sure to include a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables.
While a slice of cake or some potato chips shouldn't be forbidden foods, such low-nutrient snacks shouldn't be on the everyday after-school menu.
If you can, take your child along to the grocery store and spend some time reading the nutrition facts labels and comparing products.
Pay attention to the amounts of protein, fiber, calcium, and other important nutrients, and don't miss the chance to talk about portion sizes.
Together, choose snacks that are low in sugar, fat, and salt.
Being involved in the process makes it more likely that your child will learn to make healthy food choices.
Make healthy snacks easily available by packing them in their lunchboxes or backpacks or by having them visible and ready-to-eat at home.
If you're at home after school, a young child might enjoy helping you make a creative snack like ants on a log (celery topped with peanut butter and raisin "ants"), egg boats (hard-boiled egg wedges topped with a cheese sail), or fruit kabobs.
Older kids may enjoy a fruit smoothie, mini-pitas with hummus dip, or whole-grain crackers topped with cheese and pear slices.
Older kids often like making their own snacks, so provide the ingredients and a few simple instructions.
If dinner is just around the corner, consider allowing a "first course," such as a small salad or side vegetable while you finish preparing the family meal.
For those nights when dinner is hours away, you could opt for a more substantial snack such as half a sandwich or a quesadilla made with a whole-wheat tortilla, low-fat cheese, and salsa warmed in the microwave.
A good snack should take more time to eat than it does to prepare!
If your child goes to an after-school program or to a caregiver's house, find out if snacks are served.
If you don't like what you hear, suggest alternatives or just pack an extra snack your child can eat after school.
Lower-fat granola bars made with whole grains are a good choice.
Other options include trail mix, nuts, low-sugar dry cereal, whole-grain mini-muffins, and dried fruits.
These types of foods are especially helpful if your child plays a sport after school and needs a quick energy boost.
Again, the best strategy is to leave something healthy front and center on the kitchen counter or in the refrigerator.
A hungry child, like a hungry adult, is likely to take the path of least resistance.
Regular checkups help the doctor monitor your child's growth and development.
For years, doctors have used height and weight measurements as their primary tools for assessing a child's physical growth in relation to other children of the same age.
BMI is a calculation that uses a child's height and weight to estimate how much body fat he or she has.
Doctors use BMI to determine how appropriate a child's weight is for a certain height and age.
Kids are always rooting around in the kitchen, especially during the teen years.
For people with binge eating disorder, at first food may provide sustenance or comfort, but later it's the focus of incredible guilt and distress.
They eat unusually large amounts of food quickly and feel completely out of control as they do it, and they binge not just from time to time, but fairly regularly.
These behaviors become a pattern of eating and can alternate with dieting.
Binge eating disorder is more common in people who are obese, but it affects people with healthy weights as well.
However, there's little information on how many children and teens are affected by the disorder because the condition has only recently been recognized, and many people may be too embarrassed to seek help for it.
Adults in treatment often say their problems started in childhood or adolescence.
Still, it's believed that 2% of adult Americans - roughly 1 million to 2 million people - have the disorder.
And although the majority of people with other eating disorders are female, it's estimated that more than a third of individuals with binge eating disorder are male.
Children and teens who sometimes eat a lot don't necessarily have binge eating disorder.
Kids can have huge appetites, especially during growth spurts, when they need more nutrients to fuel their growing bodies.
So it can be difficult to determine whether a child has binge eating disorder.
But several signs distinguish someone who binge eats from someone with a "healthy appetite" . Parents may first suspect a problem when they discover large amounts of food are missing from the pantry or the refrigerator, though it's hard to imagine one child could have eaten so much.
People who binge eat may also experience feelings that are common to many eating disorders, such as depression, anxiety, guilt, or shame.
They may avoid school, work, or socializing with friends because they're ashamed of their binge eating problem.
The cause of binge eating disorder is unknown, although the National Institutes of Health (NIH) report that up to half of all people who have it also have a history of depression.
It remains unclear, however, whether binge eating brings on depression or whether people with depression are prone to the disorder.
Many people who binge eat say that episodes can be triggered by feelings of anger, sadness, boredom, or anxiety.
Scientists are also examining how brain function and body metabolism (the way the body uses energy) may affect binge eating.
It's important to distinguish binge eating disorder from other eating disorders, such as bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.
People with bulimia nervosa (sometimes called binge-purge syndrome) binge on food and then vomit or use laxatives to avoid gaining weight.
They may also fast (stop eating for a while) or compulsively exercise after an eating binge.
Like people who suffer from binge eating disorder, those with bulimia nervosa repeatedly eat excessive amounts of food and feel guilty or ashamed about it.
Unlike bulimia, however, individuals with binge eating disorder do not purge and are, therefore, frequently overweight.
Anorexia nervosa, another eating disorder, also involves feelings of guilt about eating.
Whereas people with binge eating disorder consistently overeat, people with anorexia starve themselves, causing potentially life-threatening damage to their bodies.
They may also compulsively exercise to achieve weight loss, a condition known as anorexia athletica.
A child will be diagnosed with a binge eating disorder only after discussing family dynamics, patterns of eating, and emotional issues with a doctor.
The doctor will also perform a complete physical and may order lab tests to assess some complications of obesity and nutritional adequacy.
As with any eating disorder, it's also important that the child receives therapy.
Different types of therapy can help treat binge eating disorder.
For example, family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy teach people techniques to monitor and change their eating habits and the way they respond to stress.
Family therapy includes the whole family in the process of helping the individual.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy combines the approach of helping people change self-defeating thoughts along with changing their behavior.
Counseling also helps patients look at relationships they have with others and helps them work on areas that cause them anxiety.
In some cases, doctors may prescribe antidepressant medication to be used in conjunction with therapy.
However, there's no quick fix for any eating disorder.
Treatment can take several months or longer while the person learns how to have a healthier approach to food.
Although weight-control programs are helpful for some people affected by binge eating disorder, children and teens should not begin a diet or weight-control program without the advice and supervision of a doctor.
If you suspect your child has a problem with binge eating, call your doctor or health care provider for advice and referrals to qualified mental health professionals who have experience treating eating disorders in kids.
Reassure your child that you're there to help or just to listen.
Having an eating disorder can be difficult to admit, and your child may not be ready to acknowledge having a problem.
You can also encourage healthier eating habits by modeling your own positive relationship with food and exercise and by not using food as a reward.
With the help of your family and a doctor, your child can begin the trip back to eating healthy again.
Choosing whether to breastfeed or formula feed your baby is one of the first decisions expectant parents will make.
Although there's no right or wrong choice, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) joins other organizations such as the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Dietetic Association (ADA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) in recommending breastfeeding as the best for babies.
Specifically, the AAP says babies should be breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months and that breastfeeding should continue until 12 months (and beyond) if both the mother and baby are willing.
But breastfeeding (or nursing) may not be possible or preferable for all women.
The decision to breastfeed or formula feed your baby should be based on your comfort level with breastfeeding as well as your lifestyle.
Breast milk is the ideal form of nutrition for newborns, but for mothers who are unable to breastfeed or who decide not to, infant formula is a good alternative.
If you feed your baby with a commercially prepared formula, be assured that your baby's nutritional needs will be met.
And you'll still bond with your baby just fine.
After all, whether with breast milk or formula, feeding is an important time of connection between mother and baby.
The decision to breastfeed or formula feed your baby is a very personal one.
But here are some points you may want to consider as you decide which is best for you and your new addition.
Nursing can be a wonderful experience for both mother and baby.
It provides ideal nourishment and a special bonding experience that many nursing mothers cherish.
Other factors help to protect a breastfed baby from infection by contributing to the infant's immune system by increasing the barriers to infection and decreasing the growth of organisms like bacteria and viruses.
Breast milk also naturally contains all the vitamins and minerals that a newborn requires.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates formula companies to ensure that they provide all the known necessary nutrients in their formulas.
Because some of breast milk's more complex substances are too difficult to manufacture and some have not yet been identified.
Breast milk doesn't cost a cent and because of the immunities and antibodies passed onto them through their mothers' breast milk, breastfed infants are sick less often than infants who receive formula.
For example, researchers have determined that infants who are exclusively breastfed for 4 or more months have 40% fewer episodes of ear infections.
That means they make fewer trips to the doctor's office, which equates to fewer co-pays and less money doled out for prescriptions and over-the-counter medications.
Likewise, women who breastfeed are less likely to have to take time off from work to care for their sick babies.
In a cost study published in the April 1999 issue of the journal Pediatrics, researchers determined that infants who were never breastfed would incur additional medical costs of $331 to $475 per year.
A nursing mother will need 500 extra calories per day to produce breast milk, which means that she should eat a wide variety of well-balanced foods.
This introduces breastfed babies to different tastes through their mothers' breast milk, which has different flavors depending on what their mothers have eaten.
With no bottles to mix and sterilize and no last-minute runs to the store for more formula, breast milk is always fresh and available.
And because breast milk is always the right temperature, there's no need to warm up bottles in the middle of the night.
It's also easy for breastfeeding mothers to be active - and go out and about - with their babies and know that they'll have food available for whenever their little one is hungry.
Recent studies indicate that breastfeeding might help prevent childhood and adult obesity.
According to the National Women's Health Information Center (part of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services), babies who are breastfed tend to gain less unnecessary weight, which may help them be less overweight later.
Recent studies suggest that children who were exclusively breastfed for 6 months have IQs 5 to 10 points higher than children who were formula fed. Many nursing mothers really enjoy the experience of bonding so closely with their babies.
And the skin-to-skin contact can enhance the emotional connection between mother and infant.
The ability to nourish a baby totally can also help a new mother feel confident in her ability to care for her baby.
Breastfeeding also burns calories and helps shrink the uterus, so nursing moms may be able to return to their pre-pregnancy shape and weight quicker.
In addition, studies show that breastfeeding helps lower the risk of premenopausal breast cancer and also may help decrease the risk of uterine and ovarian cancer.
Although it is the best nutritional source for babies, breastfeeding does come with some concerns that many new mothers share.
Whereas it's easy from the get-go for some, it can be challenging.
Sometimes, both mother and baby need plenty of patience and persistence to get used to the routine of breastfeeding.
But all the effort is often worth it in the long run - for both the mother and her baby.
Most parents wouldn't dream of giving their kids a toasty cup of coffee, but they may routinely serve soft drinks containing caffeine.
Although it's likely that your child will ingest caffeine at some time, it's a good idea to keep caffeine consumption to a minimum, especially in younger children.
Although the United States hasn't yet developed guidelines for caffeine intake and kids, Canadian guidelines recommend that preschool children get no more than 45 milligrams of caffeine a day.
That's equivalent to the average amount of caffeine found in a 12-ounce (355-milliliter) can of soda or four 1.
A stimulant that affects children and adults similarly, caffeine is a drug that's naturally produced in the leaves and seeds of many plants.
Caffeine is also made artificially and added to certain foods.
Caffeine is defined as a drug because it stimulates the central nervous system.
But how could any one type of food cause such a big problem?
Of course, not exercising and eating larger portions of any foods than we need take the lion's share of blame for the obesity epidemic.
But the so-called "bad" carbs - sugar and refined foods - tend to be significant contributors to excess calories.
People tend to eat more of these refined foods than needed.
And, often, foods like colas and candy provide no required nutrients, so we really don't need to eat them at all.
But just because refined carbohydrates have received a lot of flak in recent years doesn't mean that all simple sugars are bad.
Simple carbohydrates found in a lot of very nutritious foods - like fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, which provide a range of essential nutrients that support growth and overall health.
For example, fresh fruits contain simple carbs, but they have vitamins and fiber, too.
The 2005 dietary guidelines recommend that Americans eat more unrefined (often called "good") carbohydrates by saying that everyone - including kids and teens - should increase whole-grain consumption and limit their intake of added sugar.
For children, at least half of their grain intake should come from whole grains.
Unrefined carbohydrates found in whole grains are ideal, refined grain products may be fortified with folic acid (also called folate), iron, and other nutrients, and as a result may contain more of these nutrients when compared with whole-grain foods that have not been fortified.
The actual amount of grains will vary depending on your child's age, gender, and level of physical activity.
On average, school-age children should eat about 4- to 6-ounce equivalents from the grain group each day and at least half of these servings should come from whole grains.
All ounce equivalent is like a serving.
So one slice of bread, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal, or a half cup of cooked rice, cooked pasta, or hot cereal can be considered a 1-ounce equivalent.
Foods that are high in added sugar (soda, cookies, cake, candy, frozen desserts, and some fruit drinks) tend to also be high in calories and low in other valuable nutrients.
As a result, a high-sugar diet is often linked with obesity.
Eating too many sugary foods can also lead to tooth decay.
The key to keeping sugar consumption in check is moderation.
Added sugar can enhance the taste of some foods, and a little sugar, particularly if it's in a food that provides other important nutrients, such as cereal or yogurt, isn't going to tip the scale or send your child to the dentist.
Instead of giving your child foods that are low in nutrients and high in added sugar, offer healthier choices, such as fruit - a naturally sweet carbohydrate-containing snack that also contains fiber and vitamins that kids need.
One way to cut down on added sugar is to eliminate soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages.
Each 12-ounce (355-milliliter) serving of a carbonated, sweetened soft drink contains the equivalent of 10 teaspoons (49 milliliters) of sugar and 150 calories.
Sweetened drinks are the largest source of added sugar in the daily diets of U. S. children.
Consuming one 12-ounce (355-milliliter) sweetened soft drink per day increases a child's risk of obesity.
Instead of soda or juice drinks (which often contain as much added sugar as soft drinks), offer kids low-fat milk, water, or 100% fruit juice.
Although there's no added sugar in 100% fruit juice, the calories from the natural sugars found in fruit juice can add up.
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends limiting juice intake to 4-6 ounces (118-177 milliliters) for children under 7 years old, and no more than 8-12 ounces (237-355 milliliters) of juice for older kids and teens.
Ensuring that kids get a balanced, nutritious diet isn't as hard as it may seem.
Simply make good carbohydrate choices (whole grains, fruits, veggies, and low-fat milk and dairy products), stock your home with healthy choices, limit foods containing added sugar (especially those with little or no nutritional value), and encourage kids to be active every day.
When it comes to their kids, many parents don't even think about cholesterol.
But high levels of cholesterol are known to be a major factor contributing to heart disease and strokes, and the latest medical research shows coronary artery disease has its roots in childhood.
Childhood cholesterol levels weren't tracked until recently, but some experts think that high cholesterol in kids is a major underreported public health problem.
In the past few years, studies have shown a dramatic increase in obesity in children and the problems that result from being overweight.
And some pediatricians report seeing a significant increase in the number of children with elevated cholesterol levels than they did years ago.
Because the problems associated with high cholesterol generally don't show up for years, making the connection between kids' health and cholesterol is difficult for many people.
So it's important to be aware of your child's cholesterol levels, especially if either parent has high cholesterol.
Cholesterol is a waxy substance produced by the liver.
It's one of the lipids, or fats, your body makes and is used to build cell walls and form some hormones and tissues.
It's recommended that cholesterol intake be less than 300 milligrams a day.
To determine how much cholesterol is in the foods your family eats, read nutrition labels.
Also, the American Heart Association recommends that total fat intake should be 30% or less of your total calories and that saturated fat should be 10% or less.
If you never ate another bowl of ice cream or another cheeseburger, your body would have enough cholesterol to run smoothly.
That's because your liver makes enough for healthy body function.
In fact, the liver produces about 1,000 milligrams of cholesterol a day and the rest comes from the foods you eat.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that affects the respiratory and digestive systems.
CF makes children sick by disrupting the normal function of epithelial cells - cells that make up the sweat glands in the skin and that also line passageways inside the lungs, liver, pancreas, and digestive and reproductive systems.
A defect in these cells causes problems with the balance of salt and water in the body, leading it to produce thick mucus, which clogs the lungs, setting the stage for infections and other breathing problems.
In kids with CF, this mucus can also prevent the normal absorption of key nutrients and fat in the intestines, leading to poor digestion, slow growth, difficulty gaining weight, greasy bowel movements, and a decreased ability to fight infection.
At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients have a condition called pancreatic insufficiency, which means that the enzymes created in the pancreas that digest fat, starch, and protein aren't properly passed into the intestines.
This causes problems in absorbing the necessary amounts of several important nutrients.
By providing good overall nutrition along with extra fat and calories and prescribed enzymes, you can help your child with CF grow healthy and strong.
Research has shown that eating a well-balanced, nutritious diet reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, strokes, some cancers, and osteoporosis.
And the grocery store shelves are full of foods with packaging promising to help do that.
But it's important to take a close look - beyond the promises - at the nutritional values, ingredients, and calorie counts in the food you're buying, and to understand how they factor into your family's healthy eating.
Food labels provide this information and allow you to make informed healthy food choices to help meet your family's nutritional needs.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) require labels on almost all packaged foods that include nutrition information in readable type.
The information usually appears on the back or side of packaging under the title "Nutrition Facts" . It's also displayed in grocery stores near fresh foods, like fruits, vegetables, and fish.
Manufacturers often make claims about the healthfulness of a food on the front of a package - like "fat free" or "no cholesterol" . Many people wonder if they can trust these claims to be true.
The fact is, the FDA does require food makers to provide scientific evidence in order to make those claims.
Even so, it's a good idea to carefully read the claims and understand what they mean.
Reduced fat means that a product has 25% less fat than the same regular brand.
Light means that the product has 50% less fat than the same regular product.
Low fat means a product has less than 3 grams of fat per serving.
At the top of each food label you'll see an amount listing for serving size.
These are determined by the food manufacturer, and they're based on the amount that people generally eat.
All of the information about the nutritional value of the food that is listed on the label is given according to the serving size.
So if a serving size is 2 crackers and you eat 4 crackers - which would be two servings - you need to double all of the nutrition information.
The number of servings per container tells you how many serving sizes are in the whole package.
So if one serving is 1 cup, and the entire package has 5 cups, there are 5 servings per package.
A calorie is a unit of energy that measures how much energy a food provides to the body.
The number of calories that's listed on the food label indicates how many calories are in one serving.
The second number, calories from fat, tells the total calories in one serving that come from fat.
The label lists fat so that people can monitor the amount of fat in their diets.
Dietitians generally recommend that no more than 30% of calories come from fat over the course of the day.
That means that if the food you eat over the course of a day contains 2,000 calories total, no more than 600 of these should come from fat.
These numbers show how many calories are in 1 gram of fat, carbohydrate, and protein.
This information must be printed on every Nutrition Facts label for reference.
Percent daily values are listed in the right-hand column in percentages, and they tell how much of a certain nutrient a person will get from eating one serving of that food.
Ideally, the goal is to eat 100% of each of those nutrients each day.
If a serving of a food has 18% protein, then that food is providing 18% of your daily protein needs if you eat 2,000 calories per day.
Percent daily value is most useful for determining whether a food is high or low in certain nutrients.
